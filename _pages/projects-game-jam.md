This is a short introduction paragraph that explains the project, the theme, and the main goal of the jam. It gives visitors quick context before they view the media.

{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/placeholder-2.jpg" alt="Game Jam screenshot" caption="An example of how to insert a single image" %}

Here is a second paragraph with more detail about the gameplay loop, tools used, and what the team learned during the jam. This text sits between the intro image and the gallery.

## Gameplay Gallery
{% include gallery id="gallery_gameplay" layout="third" %}
## Game Art Gallery
