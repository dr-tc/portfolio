## 3. Quote - Think of ways to use this in your portfolio and I don't want to see this quote used in your final portfolios! {#quote}

{% include quote text="This was the most polished student game I have ever played in my life!" author="Mentor Feedback" %}

## 4. Single image - Use the `figure` include. Remember that it's good practice to include ALT text for accessibility. {#image}
{% include figure image_path="/assets/images/placeholder-2.png" alt="Game Jam screenshot" caption="An example of how to insert a single image" %}

## 5. Gallery - A gallery is a good way to showcase some of the various components of your game. Remember to name your galery appropriately. Look at the `gallery` include to see the available keys.

## 6. Second gallery in the same page - Make sure you reference the gallery id. {#second-gallery}
## Game Art Gallery
{% include gallery id="gallery_gameart" layout="third" thumb_height="180px" %}

## 7. Video - Look at the `video` include to see how it handles vidoes from different sources. Also be mindful to only extract and use the `video id`.  {#video}
Let's talk about the Rick Roll phenomena...

  url="/assets/downloads/Project-proposal.pdf"
  button_label="Download Project Proposal"

%}
